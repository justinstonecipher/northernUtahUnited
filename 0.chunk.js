Soccer, the largest youth sports organization in the country, has reported\r\n      a 9 percent increase in its membership over the past year — a figure the association believes is indicative of the\r\n      growing interest in soccer across the United States and the excitement generated by the 2014 FIFA World Cup in addition\r\n      to improved programs for associations.</p>\r\n    <p>In 2014, US Youth Soccer saw its annual registration grow to 3,055,148, meaning that more than 4 percent of the U.S.\r\n      population 18 years old and younger played US Youth Soccer. The growth included new players and players returning to\r\n      the association. The year featured added awareness of the game through a highly talked about FIFA World Cup, the continued\r\n      expansion of MLS and 82 live broadcasts from the US Youth Soccer National Championships.</p>\r\n    <p>“More parents are seeing the game of soccer, along with the teamwork and fitness involved, and kids see the fun, which\r\n      translates into more active youth,” said US Youth Soccer Director of Marketing and Communications Todd Roby. “Last\r\n      year marked our 40th Anniversary, and we are obviously delighted with the growth seen by our strong national association,\r\n      which continues to feature best-in-class events, programs and educational opportunities for our membership. As we begin\r\n      2015, we expect it will be another exciting year for our game.”</p>\r\n    <p>US Youth Soccer is proud to be the “Game for ALL Kids,” and it offers several programs to meet the needs of any youth\r\n      player — from beginners to recreational players to competitive players looking to continue their careers at the college,\r\n      professional and National Team levels.</p>\r\n    <p>Sixteen US Youth Soccer alumni were on the U.S. Men’s National Team that helped bring soccer to the forefront of the\r\n      nation’s attention while playing in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

We, Northern Utah United, are proud to be a part of\r\n        that enthusiastic growth. The sport of soccer has become so popular because of the many aspects of the game that\r\n        benefit every type of player. There is a place in youth soccer for any player - for kids that are competitive, laid\r\n        back, naturally athletic, and those that are slower to develop their athletic skills. It can be played throughout\r\n        a person’s life, with few players or many players, and on a multitude of different surfaces - sand, turf, asphalt,\r\n        etc. It contributes to a fit lifestyle, promotes camaraderie and team work, and also helps players develop individual\r\n        goals and work toward them. Soccer helps kids develop good life-skills. It is a game for all.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-6\">\r\n      <img src=\"/images/youth-players.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-sm-12\">\r\n      <p>However, given the extensive nature of soccer and the multitude of options, it can be a bit confusing for parents to\r\n        determine the right soccer program for their child. This document was written to help parents explore the different\r\n        local youth soccer options so that they can choose the right program for their specific goals. We hope once you read\r\n        through our list of products that you will be able to select the right product for your child.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\r\n  <div class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Recreational &amp; Academy Soccer (Ages 4 &amp; older)</h3>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n    <p>Recreational soccer is our most fundamental beginning program. The goal of our recreational program is to provide a program\r\n      that will teach young players the fundamentals of soccer, while providing an environment that is fun, low pressure,\r\n      and non-competitive. Teams are coached by volunteer parent coaches, and are formed randomly combining children that\r\n      live within a close proximity. Our recreational philosophy is in compliance with all recommendations made by FIFA,\r\n      USSF, US Youth Soccer, and the Utah Youth Soccer Association (UYSA). Our policy is that all players be guaranteed a\r\n      minimum of ½ of each game, and that all players have the opportunity to play at all positions, regardless of skill\r\n      or experience. This program’s main focus is participation, learning soccer skills, and having fun. During the season,\r\n      we schedule two sessions a week. Additionally, most teams will also schedule practices.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\r\n  <div class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"panel-title\">U5/6 - U7/8 Players</h3>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n    <p>The midweek scheduled session (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday) is a training session, where two teams are scheduled\r\n      together and play soccer-centered games and drills with an eye toward learning the basics. Both coaches work cooperatively\r\n      for the first 30 minutes to run these sessions, based on training information that they are given. The last 15 minutes\r\n      of the session is a practice scrimmage between the two teams, allowing them to put into practice what they have learned.\r\n      The coaches act as referees and manage the time and substitutions. The second session each week is on Saturday. These\r\n      sessions are scheduled as games, with youth referees assigned to officiate the U8 games (the U6 games allow the coaches\r\n      on the field, so the coaches act as referees, managing the time and substitutions).</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\r\n  <div class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"panel-title\">U10 &amp; Older Players</h3>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n    <p>These players also have two games a week: One during the week (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday) and one on Saturday.\r\n      Both sessions are scheduled games with a full three-man youth referee crew officiating. Teams are coached by volunteer\r\n      parent coaches who are given training materials that are specifically designed for the age and skill level of their\r\n      teams. This outdoor recreational soccer programs take place twice a year. The Fall season takes place in September\r\n      and October, with registration taking place in June and July. The Spring season takes place in April and May, with\r\n      registration taking place in January and February. Players may register for both seasons or for one season individually.\r\n      Uniforms are available at Al’s Sporting Goods in Logan. The uniform is a reversible Navy and White and maybe used for\r\n      multiple years, or passed down to younger siblings. The cost is about $20.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\r\n  <div class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Competition Soccer (Ages 8 &amp; older) | Challenger League vs. State Competition</h3>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n    <p>If your player is U9 (in Third grade) or older, and you notice that he/she has a real aptitude for soccer and/or a desire\r\n      to play at a higher level than Recreational soccer, or that they want to compete with other teams for a championship,\r\n      then you should probably look into a having them tryout for a competition team. There are two different Competition\r\n      programs available: The Challenger League &amp; the UYSA State Competition Program. Teams form through tryouts, usually\r\n      in June, for the next year. Coaches choose their own teams, and teams compete against other competition teams for standings.\r\n      The amount of play time a player receives and what position a player plays is up to the coach, and is usually based\r\n      on skill, commitment, and player development. Teams typically begin advertising their tryout information at the end\r\n      of May. Tryout information can be found here on our website in the local pages of the newspaper under community events.</p>\r\n    <p>Coaches that coach competition soccer, must take a certification class to gain their “E” license certificate, more experienced\r\n      coaches may hold even higher levels of certification, such as a “D”, “C”, “B” or “A” coaching license. There are a\r\n      few different competitive league options: </p>\r\n    <h5>The Challenger League</h5>\r\n    <p>competition program that primary competes just within Cache and Box Elder Counties. We have one (1) to two (2) divisions\r\n      each from U9 Boys and Girls, up through U14 Boys and Girls, and sometime also High School divisions (U15-U18). The\r\n      Challenger League has a Fall and a Spring season each year.</p>\r\n    <h5>The UYSA State Competition League</h5>\r\n    <p>state wide competition program. The State Comp league has multiple divisions for each age group from U9 - U18 boys and\r\n      Girls. (The U9 and U10 State program is specifically known as the X-League.) Teams that compete in the State competition\r\n      program may travel anywhere, but most younger teams will only have to travel throughout Northern Utah. Higher ranking\r\n      teams, and the older teams will likely have to travel throughout the state. The State Competition program also has\r\n      a Fall and a spring season each year.</p>\r\n    <h3>League Comparisons:</h3>\r\n    <table>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <th>Challenger League</th>\r\n        <th>UYSA State Competition</th>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Better Competition than the lower UYSA State divisions</td>\r\n        <td>Better competition in the higher divisions</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Uses USSF Certified Referees</td>\r\n        <td>Uses USSF Certified Referees</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Requires Certified Coaches</td>\r\n        <td>Requires Certified Coaches</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Administrated and scheduled locally</td>\r\n        <td>Administrated by the UYSA State Office in Sandy, UT</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Affiliated and in compliance with recommendations by UYSA, USYSA, USSF &amp; FIFA</td>\r\n        <td>Affiliated and in compliance with recommendations by UYSA, USYSA, USSF &amp; FIFA</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>U9 - U11 plays 8v8 <br/>U12 &amp; Older plays 11v11</td>\r\n        <td>U9 plays 6v6 / U10-U11 plays 8v8<br/>U12 &amp; Older plays 11v11</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Teams may compete in any tournaments in the state except for State Cup</td>\r\n        <td>Registered teams may compete in State Cup and all other tournaments</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n      <tr>\r\n        <td>Less Expensive and Less Travel</td>\r\n        <td>Exposure to more teams outside Cache Valley, Box Elder, and Bear River</td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n    </table>\r\n    <p>Generally speaking, we recommend that newly formed competition teams begin in the Challenger league, and compete locally\r\n      until they need more competition.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\r\n  <div class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Team Affiliation - Independent Team Soccer vs. Club Soccer</h3>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n    <p>Teams may not register directly with a league, such as the Challenger League or the UYSA State Competition League. Teams\r\n      must register through a member organization which is affiliated through the Utah Youth Soccer Association (UYSA), in\r\n      order to participate in either league There are several local member organizations within Cache County and Box Elder\r\n      county and many affiliated teams throughout Cache, Box Elder, and Southern Idaho. We hope that you will chose to either\r\n      register your team (as a coach) through one of our programs (Northern Utah United Independents) - OR - that you will register your player (as a parent) through one of our associated teams.</p>\r\n    <p>The trick is to find the right team, and the right situation, that best fits with your goals, philosophy, and your family’s\r\n      logistics. There are two types of Teams - Independent Teams and Club Teams.</p>\r\n    <h5>Independent Teams</h5>\r\n    <p>Organized under the Northern Utah United side of our organization - are typically coached by a parent-coach and a few\r\n      assistants. Most of these Independent coaches have determined their own strategy and training philosophy based on their\r\n      own personal experience and personally attained coaching education. They may work and train with other teams and/or\r\n      coaches, but are not obligated to. They may also share a name with other teams, but usually have their own autonomy\r\n      to coach, train, and field players as they see fit. They are part of a member organization (such as Northern Utah United),\r\n      but are loosely bound to it as through registration and general administrative principles, but operate without specific\r\n      demands as to how their team should be trained or organized.</p>\r\n    <h5>Club Soccer</h5>\r\n    <!--<p>Organized under the Infinity SC side of our organization - provides a more cooperative approach to soccer. Cooperatively,\r\n      all Infinity SC teams operate under the same training philosophy that all of our coaches are trained with and held\r\n      to. This provides a more consistent level of training than typically provided by independent teams. Infinity Soccer\r\n      Club players also have access to training opportunities outside of the club from high level trainers brought in from\r\n      the Salt Lake area. Clubs typically hold one a mass tryout for each age group, and then sort players according to skill\r\n      level and need. However, roster continuity is considered as well. Club soccer also has the added advantage of fluid\r\n      movement of players between teams, as players progress or develop or as they need more playing time. Infinity Club\r\n      Soccer provides ongoing coaches’ training for our coaching staff, and specialized director training for our players,\r\n      in addition to the training done by each individual coach.</p>-->\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\r\n  <div class=\"panel-heading\">\r\n    <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"panel-body\">\r\n    <p>So, does this mean one is better than the other? It depends on what your goals are for your player. Generally speaking:\r\n      Club teams require a greater commitment, have higher level training and playing opportunities, but can be more expensive.\r\n      Generally speaking: Independent teams train closer to home, are often less expensive, and have fewer roster changes.\r\n      Of course, those are generalities. There are certainly exceptions to these generalities.</p>\r\n      <p>Both options provide healthy competition. There are both Independent and Club teams in the highest divisions of State Competition, and both Independent teams and Club teams that are still in the developmental stages fighting their way from the bottom of the Challenger league. Additionally, both Independent teams and Club teams compete in both the Challenger League and in the UYSA State Competition league.</p>\r\n      <p><i>Additionally, both Independent teams and Club teams compete in both the Challenger League and in the UYSA State Competition League.</i></p>\r\n      <img src=\"/images/player_flow.jpg\" alt=\"\">\r\n      <p>The challenge for each family, is to identify which options work best for your family and your goals, and what do you feel is in the best interest of your child. Our best advice is to check out all of the potential options, and ask a lot of questions. Take into consideration time, travel, budget, and commitment. Ask your potential coaches about their philosophy, how they train, how they rotate players, what other soccer events - such as summer tournaments - they plan on participating in, and the associated cost. Also, take into consideration which league each team plans on competing in, the local Challenger League, or the UYSA State Competition league.</p>\r\n      <p>Northen Utah United is committed to providing a healthy positive opportunity for every player.

module.exports = "<h2>HANDBALL OR DELIBERATE HANDLING?</h2>\r\n<div>May 17, 2012</div>\r\n<div>Author Unknown</div>\r\n<p>Handball, defined by many as, \"contact between the hand and the ball\" is not a foul, never has been, and referees are instructed\r\n  not to call it a foul. Deliberate handling of the ball is a foul and referees are instructed to call it as such. So what\r\n  is the difference you might ask? Let me give some examples of \"handballs\" that are not fouls:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Players are standing in a wall with their hands placed across their chest or in front of the groin area to protect themselves.\r\n    The ball is kicked into their arms or hands. While the ball has made contact with the hands or arms, this is not deliberate\r\n    handling of the ball and is not a foul.</li>\r\n  <li>A hard shot, taken 3-5 yards away from a player , streaks toward the player’s head. In a flinch reaction, the player throws\r\n    his hands up to protect his face and, in the process, strikes the ball. This is not deliberate handling of the ball.\r\n    It is an involuntary reaction that is guaranteed to happen no matter how good the player is. This is not a foul.</li>\r\n  <li>A player dribbles the ball on one of our \"smooth as satin\" fields when the ball hits a rock or clump of grass and bounces\r\n    up. The ball strikes the player in the hand. This is not deliberate handling of the ball. And it doesn’t even matter\r\n    if an advantage is gained. Consider the following:</li>\r\n  <li>A striker shoots on goal. The keeper catches it. The striker turns and begins running up field vigorously pumping her arms.\r\n    The keeper gets off a low line drive punt that arrives at the striker just as she swings her arm backwards. Her elbow\r\n    strikes the ball driving it backwards into the goal. Did the player gain an advantage? Certainly, she scored a goal.\r\n    Did she deliberately handle the ball? Not hardly. She was running with her back to the ball and didn’t even see it. Unless\r\n    the referee sees the team practicing this play before the game, it is not a foul!!! Proper restart is a kick-off after\r\n    the goal.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>All of these are examples of what may be called \"handball\" by some but clearly they are not deliberate and must not be called\r\n  fouls. Well, you might ask, if these are not fouls, what are?</p>\r\n<p>The following are examples of deliberate handling of the ball that must be penalized:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>A shot is about to go into the goal and a fullback deliberately puts out her hand to stop the ball from going in the goal.\r\n    This is a deliberate handling of the ball and is a foul.</li>\r\n  <li>A long pass is about to go over the head of a defender who leaps in the air and bats the ball down. This is a deliberate\r\n    handling of the ball and is a foul.</li>\r\n  <li>A player fighting for a ball falls down. To prevent the other player from breaking free with the ball, the player reaches\r\n    out and grabs the ball(this is not the same as making accidental contact after falling down)Clearly a deliberate act.\r\n    Clearly a foul.</li>\r\n  <li>A player goes to trap the ball on her chest but traps it with her arms instead. This is deliberate handling of the ball.\r\n    She may not have meant to do it, but she deliberately placed her arms where they contacted the ball. Foul.</li>\r\n  <li>In contrast to the second example above of a non-foul, a player puts up his hands to prevent being hit with a long through\r\n    pass that travels 20 –30 yards in the air. This is a foul because the player has lots of time and lots of choices. He\r\n    could head the ball, chest trap the ball, or even get out of the way. Putting the hands up is deliberately choosing to\r\n    handle the ball. This is a foul.</li>\r\n  <li>Finally, there are the deliberate handling of the ball by the better players who miraculously deflect the ball down to\r\n    their feet when the referee is shielded. Since referees almost never see these anyway, it is probably not a good example.\r\n    Should, however, any of us see a player deliberately deflecting the ball with his/her hands or arms, this is a foul.</li>\r\n  <p>It seems that the first \"rule\" anyone learns about soccer is that you can’t use your hands and that if you strike the ball\r\n    with your hands it is a foul! Unfortunately, while this is partially true, it is not correct. It is a foul only if, in\r\n    the opinion of the referee, the player deliberately handled the ball. Too many \"handball\" fouls are being called when\r\n    no foul occurred. The game, which is meant to flow, is needlessly being stopped and free kicks are being awarded when\r\n    they shouldn’t be.</p>\r\n  <h5>To all referees:</h5>\r\n  <p>Do not call \"handball\" and award a free kick or penalty kick to the other team. \"Handball\" it is not a foul. The correct\r\n    foul is \"deliberate handling of the ball.\" More importantly, call the foul only if you are convinced that it was a deliberate\r\n    handling of the ball. All the accidental strikings of the hand or arm by the ball are not deliberate and are not to be\r\n    called unless the player then takes advantage of the contact to deliberately direct the ball to a desirable location.</p>\r\n  <p>Ignore all help from others who call out \"Handball ref\"! A suggestion: When you see an alleged \"handball,\" call out loudly\r\n    to let everyone know you saw it but are not fooled and will not be goaded into calling a foul. \"No foul!\" or \"Not deliberate!\"\r\n    or the aforementioned \"Give me a break, willya!\" work great.</p>\r\n  <h5>To all the parents, coaches, and players who want to help the referees:</h5>\r\n  <p>Please don’t yell \"handball\" at the referee. He/she is being told not to call handball fouls and to ignore your help. If\r\n    you feel you must help the referee, then please yell \"deliberate handling of the ball, ref!\" if you are convinced this\r\n    is what happened. </p>\r\n</ol>"

It is the goal of this committee\r\n                to actively recruit, develop, certify and advance referees for all levels of play.</p>\r\n              <p>The Utah Soccer Referee program offers two Entry Level clinics, the USSF Grade 8 Referee and Grade 9 Recreational\r\n                Referee clinics, which are sponsored by affiliate organizations in various locations throughout the state.\r\n                In order to become certified participants must attend one of the two courses. The courses differ in content\r\n                and length. It is necessary to determine which clinic is more appropriate for age of the participant and/or\r\n                the desired level of participation.</p>\r\n              <p>The <a href=\"http://www.utahsoccerrefs.com/documents/2010_Information_for_New_Referees_English.pdf\">Information for New Referees</a>                document provides more insight into what is expected and required once you become a certified referee.</p>\r\n\r\n              <br/>\r\n              <hr>\r\n              <br/>\r\n\r\n              <h4>For New Competition Referees</h4>\r\n              <p>Once you successfully complete a referee course (see the course information below) and register with the USSF,\r\n                you will receive your badge and will need to get appropriate referee gear, including a soccer referee uniform,\r\n                soccer referee flags, soccer referee cards, whistles, watches and shoes.</p>\r\n              <p>Cost of the soccer referee uniforms vary but you can purchase good quality soccer referee uniforms for as little\r\n                as $19.00 per referee jersey and $12 per referee shorts. You should also know that USSF approved five different\r\n                colors of jerseys for its referees, including gold, black, blue, green and red. You should eventually purchase\r\n                all five colors (you want to be able to change your jersey in the event one of the teams wears similar colors)\r\n                but the gold referee jersey is considered standard and this is the one you should buy first.</p>\r\n              <p>You can also choose from three different soccer assistant referee flags, including checkered soccer referee\r\n                flags, diamond pattern soccer referee flags and solid soccer referee flags. They all are acceptable and which\r\n                ones you use are a matter of your personal taste and preference. Good quality soccer assistant referee flags\r\n                will cost you between $8.00 to $15.00 for a pair.</p>\r\n              <p>With respect to soccer referee whistles, FOX 40 whistles are probably the best known and widely used referee\r\n                whistles in the U.S but Acme whistles are a good choice as well. You can choose from multiple different designs\r\n                such as classic or finger grip, with cushion mouth grip (CMG) or without. The cushion mouth grip whistles\r\n                are ideal for those who hold their whistles in their mouths for extended periods of time. The most popular\r\n                referee whistles on the market today are also pealess because they are the most reliable. Since there is\r\n                no moving parts, these whistle will not freeze or jam and produce consistent, clear sound. At the very minimum,\r\n                you should have two whistles with you at all time during your games. Depending on its design and its features,\r\n                you should be prepared to spend between $3.00 and up to $10.00 on a good whistle.</p>\r\n              <p>There are also many different types of soccer referee cards to choose from. There are, for example, write-on\r\n                referee cards and single replacement referee cards. These cards are economically priced and you should be\r\n                able to purchase them for as little as $2.00 to $4.00 per set. Somewhat more expensive but very popular are\r\n                soccer referee wallets. The wallets come with one set of referee cards and may also include a coin holder\r\n                pocket or Report Form with Score Pads. There are also fully equipped Soccer Referee Kits and organizers that\r\n                include cards, score pads, notebooks, and room for your whistles and pen. These organizers will help you\r\n                keep all of your small referee equipment items in one easy-to-find place. The wallets are priced somewhere\r\n                between $4.00 and $8.00 and organizers up to $20.00.</p>\r\n              <p>You will also have to get a soccer referee watch, preferably with a timer that has a stop/start function, to\r\n                keep time of the game as well as wasted and added time. Some of the most popular referee watches are Champion\r\n                Referee Watch and Robic Referee Watch. However, there are other sports watches such as those manufactured\r\n                by Ohsen or O.T.S. that do the job as well. Their prices range from $15.00 to $33.00. You should always wear\r\n                and keep the time of the game on two referee watches so that in case when one of them malfunctions the other\r\n                shows the correct time.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    <!-- /.row -->\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>"

Potential\r\n  future additions include an RSL Women's Professional Team, and other youth development age groups.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"Every city looks for an iconic landmark that will identify it regionally and internationally,\" said Herriman City Mayor\r\n  Carmen Freeman. \"From a job creation standpoint, the stimulation of economic growth, with great benefits for our residents,\r\n  to have such a unique opportunity of an incredibly inclusive nature is enormous. Herriman City offers something unique\r\n  of its own, a wonderful location consistent with our belief in providing an iconic setting for a world-class venue in this\r\n  sector of the valley.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In conjunction with the primary RSL complex, Hansen has created the non-profit \"RSL Youth Academy Foundation\" which will\r\n  create \"regional training centers\" across Utah and potentially Arizona, with the first three locations slated to be North\r\n  Logan, Ogden and West Valley City, with Orem, St. George planned for Phase II. These $2 million indoor/outdoor facilities\r\n  - each of which includes multiple classrooms - implement an RSL-designed curriculum to the more than 60,000 players, coaches\r\n  and referees in need of specialized training (ages 14 and younger), providing an entry point for elite development in the\r\n  sport, potential academy aspirations and an adjunct level of training regimens designed to complement the already excellent\r\n  club/recreational system in Utah.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"Our collective passion about building this community is at the core of everything we do, with my job being to guide the\r\n  group and lead us in how we connect to the community of nearly 10 million people across Utah and Arizona,\" continued Hansen.\r\n  \"I'm Salt Lake, I'm Utah, this is what I care about, and this is what the RSL values reflect, the club rooted civically\r\n  in the community with everyone invited as a point of unification.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"We embrace this sense of community through so many facets: our Foundation, the Utah and Arizona Academies, as an RSL fan,\r\n  as a Monarchs fan, as we grow and connect with youth teams. The fun part of our program is there are numerous places to\r\n  connect, with no one excluded, with literally everyone having a place in the RSL Family.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In Herriman, the Training Complex Amenities include a total of eight (8) fields, with one for Herriman City public use and\r\n  a total of seven (7) regulation-size soccer fields (75 yards wide by 120 yards long). Four of the fields will be natural\r\n  grass and outdoor, with the remaining three fields utilizing state-of-the-art artificial surface. Two of the artificial\r\n  fields will be housed in a 208,000 sq-ft. structure, the largest pre-engineered freespan building in North America. Atop\r\n  this building will be a solar panel array from Auric Solar, roughly half the size of its Rio Tinto Stadium installation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"This defines professionalization of soccer in America,\" said Craig Waibel, Real Salt Lake General Manager. \"This is commitment\r\n  from an owner to build an organization - not build a building, not build a field and call it an organization - this is\r\n  commitment beyond what we've seen to this point. This is creating a definition for our organization that's going to exist\r\n  and identifying what defines us for years to come.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In addition to the items mentioned above, RSL's Herriman Training Complex will also sit adjacent to a 250-student STEM (science,\r\n  technology, engineering, and math) charter school developed by Utah State University, with 77,000 square feet of classrooms\r\n  and a 90-acre campus. Intended to serve as the \"Harvard of Soccer,\" the charter school will host approximately 50 students\r\n  from out of state, with these students boarded on-site in a satellite structure. Adjacent to that structure will be facilities\r\n  to house visiting Real Monarchs' opponents, visiting academy teams, and potentially international teams traveling to train\r\n  in America.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"Herriman is led by great people to work with,\" said Rio Tinto Stadium General Manager Craig Martin, the project leader from\r\n  RSL. \"Mayor Freeman and the City Manager Gordon Haight - among many, many others - have been very forward-thinking and\r\n  aggressive in attracting the RSL/Monarchs and Academy infrastructure on a fast track. All the Herriman principals have\r\n  been cooperative and flexible, which is why we are able to break ground by the end of the month, and will be open for business\r\n  in July 2017.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The facility will incorporate food and beverage operations allowing for daily meals for multiple team tenants, as well as\r\n  meals for all charter school students. The facility will employ approximately 50 full-time staff members (coaches, school\r\n  staff, food and beverage staff, cleaning, maintenance, and grounds crew). Part-time staff will number approximately 20.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"A number of months ago, we knew this was an opportunity being actively sought by other communities,\" said Herriman City\r\n  Councilor Coralee Moser. \"We had land available, with views that are amazing; the Mountain View Corridor provides access\r\n  - from day one, we were excited to make this a reality, and we are thrilled to partner with Mr. Hansen to make our city\r\n  the home for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"We have a passion for how our residents live, work and play, and this Complex and the adjacent STEM school will provide\r\n  amazing value for our residents,\" continues Moser. \"We are excited about Dell Loy's vision for the facility, the prospect\r\n  of both local and international visitors, as well as the ability to expand the campus as the community embraces the overall\r\n  vision and increasing desire for education, entertainment and recreational value.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Groundbreaking expected to commence late April, 2016, with the Facility opening in August, 2017, for that year's Academy\r\n  classes, and fully operational in advance of the 2018 MLS / USL campaigns.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"This complex will serve as the crown jewel of Herriman City, with our residents experiencing huge benefits on all fronts,\"\r\n  said Nicole Martin, Herriman City Councilor. \"It is rare yet incredible that a successful entity such as RSL shares our\r\n  City's vision for creating a family-friendly, world-class destination, and now we become essentially a 'soccer-topia' to\r\n  hone athletic and academic skills for decades to come.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Last Saturday, April 2, RSL and the Monarchs saw a combined 11 current or former Academy players included in the pair of\r\n  18-man Claret-and-Cobalt rosters for RSL's 2-1 win at Kansas City and the Monarchs' 3-3 draw with LA Galaxy II, a testament\r\n  to the quality of the club's nascent developmental program.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"We already have a great Academy environment in Casa Grande, but the distance hasn't allowed us to do things that other clubs\r\n  are able to do,\" said RSL Vice-President of Soccer Administration Rob Zarkos. \"The Herriman Complex gives us an integrated\r\n  team environment, which will allow us to do a better job with our young players, having all the teams in one venue with\r\n  staggered times, as well as extend our academy presence to dovetail with the Arizona location.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Adjacent to the facility, plans are underway for a residential and commercial mix of real estate development, with projections\r\n  for more than 400 new homes and over 600 apartment units, as well as 32 acres of retail and mixed-use zoning.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"From a Herriman City perspective, this Complex will serve as a centerpiece for city-wide commercial and residential development,\"\r\n  said Jared Henderson, Herriman City Councilor. \"As our city is connected via a major transportation corridor, we connect\r\n  Salt Lake valley with Utah County; the residential component, along with restaurants, hotels, etc. will provide so much\r\n  for our residents - recreational amenities, jobs, and more - will jumpstart development, provide an impetus as we look\r\n  forward.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"We've been excited about this from day one, and we've seen that Mr. Hansen and RSL don't go small, they goes big and do\r\n  things the right way,\" said Craig Tischner, Herriman City Councilor. \"In all of Mr. Hansen's businesses, he invests with\r\n  both short-term and long-term benefit in mind, and this will exponentially stimulate economic growth and the standing and\r\n  reputation for Herriman City, now a worldwide destination through soccer and more.\"\r\n</p>"

module.exports = "<h2>Teach Principles, Not Aspects</h2>\r\n<div>By: ISC Coach Travis Clements</div>\r\n<div>June 8th, 2011</div>\r\n<p>As a coach and trainer, there are only so many hours in a day, and only so many hours we have with our kids to teach them\r\n  how to play soccer. If we want to maximize our time and get the most out of the sessions we have, those sessions need to\r\n  be age appropriate and centered around universal concepts, which I will call “Principles” of the game.</p>\r\n<p>When we see the professional game on a Saturday, what are we impressed with? As adults, we are naturally drawn to the tactics\r\n  of the game, the formation used, attacking patterns, spacing and spectacular feats of skill and athleticism. We also have\r\n  an appreciation of team chemistry, the melding of complimentary players and the unity of the squad. It’s a fallacy to project\r\n  these aspects of the professional game into youth soccer if we hope to develop players into what we see and admire on the\r\n  weekend. If we spend our time on these aspects of the game, our players will never get there. Why? They will never develop\r\n  the foundation of skill and understanding of the game needed to play it at a high level.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately the novice coach, as well as the coach who’s focused on immediate team success, invariably chooses to spend\r\n  their time addressing “aspects” of the game. Aspects of the game are concepts or features of play that are not always true.\r\n  The most common of these aspects is positional play. Information taught to a player to help them play a certain position,\r\n  like Goalkeeper or Wing, is not very useful if they aren’t playing that position. Youth players need the efficiency of\r\n  being trained principles that are *always* useful, saving specialized topics for when the basics are mastered. Common examples\r\n  of narrow, inefficient training topics include the popular “Through ball.” At youth levels it is more accurately described\r\n  as a “kick into space” because the players lack the technique and tactical understanding to make it otherwise. Some choose\r\n  to spend all their time with set plays, restarts, and creating patterns of play in the mold of typical “American” sports.\r\n  These methods don’t advance the development of players in a positive or efficient way. Some are worse than teaching nothing\r\n  at all! Consider on defense, teaching players to kick the ball out of bounds to be “safe.” It conditions players to not\r\n  read the game, to not trust their ability on the ball and confirms a lack of faith in them from coaches, parents, and teammates\r\n  alike! They are denied the chance to execute technical skills under pressure. Those players become mindless robots, predictable\r\n  and unable to think quickly or solve problems on the fly. They lack creativity, imagination and flair. How ironic that\r\n  those traits so valued at the elite level are being systematically trained out of our players in youth soccer! </p>\r\n<p>It’s easy to stand at a distance and be critical, point fingers and detail shortcomings. What is the solution? If we are\r\n  holding the kids back by spending so much time teaching aspects of the game, what do we do to fix it?</p>\r\n<p>In youth soccer the players must first be taught the founding principles of play. This takes years. Shortcuts taken during\r\n  this stage of training will haunt the players for the rest of their playing career. Just like we teach addition and subtraction\r\n  before taking on multiplication and division, (let alone fractions and variables!) we need to lay a foundation of basics\r\n  before expanding and specializing. Technical skill is universal to the game and is only acquired, refined and mastered\r\n  through constant contact with the ball. If we want our players to have ball skills and to be comfortable and calm on the\r\n  ball, we must teach possession and dribbling before we teach passing. Good decision-making is a universal skill that is\r\n  only acquired, refined and mastered by players when they are placed in situations that require it. They must be allowed\r\n  to play without fear of failure, a master of their own environment, where the competition of the game and their internal\r\n  motivation to win drives them to find ways to achieve success. A player who is expected to listen and obey during play\r\n  is not learning to make decisions or solve problems.</p>\r\n<p>Teaching players to play in positions is not necessarily bad. The correct teaching of positional play needs to begin at its\r\n  most basic elements, its principles, with every player exposed to every position. It begins with attacking and defending\r\n  individually, and then expands to include a teammate, then eventually teammates. It’s not about Forwards, Midfielders and\r\n  Defenders. Good positional play is derived through players addressing questions posed by the game, not in relation to a\r\n  painted line or an area on the field. Players need to be trained in ways that help them recognize space, pressure and support,\r\n  regardless of their assigned position. Don’t teach them to play a position; teach them to play soccer! </p>\r\n<p>Time spent standing in lines or practicing set plays from restarts is time forever lost that could have been spent with a\r\n  ball at the players feet in small-sided games that inherently teach the kids how to play. Why practice crossing the ball,\r\n  or corner kicks, when most of the players lack the technical ability to have success finishing those plays? That type of\r\n  training is so stagnant, short-sighted and inefficient! Lost touches translate into undeveloped technical skill. The absence\r\n  of playing while training denies players’ time spent making decisions on and off the ball. Soccer is a dynamic, fluid game,\r\n  so it stands to reason that it is best taught utilizing activities and games that replicate the game environment, focused\r\n  on the topic for that session. A well-devised small-sided game in practice will inherently teach the players correct principles\r\n  of how to play in a full-sided game.</p>\r\n<p>Short term successes don’t justify the cost of lost opportunity. We must have the maturity to set aside our egos and adult\r\n  competitiveness to benefit the kids. The topics needing attention by our youth are seemingly endless: Dribbling, Passing,\r\n  Moves, Movement, Receiving, Juggling, Support, First Touch, Communication, Winning 50/50 balls, Striking the ball, Heading,\r\n  Balance and Agility… </p>\r\n<p>Teaching soccer through the principles of the game is a slower, deeper approach that requires patience and a long-term perspective\r\n  of player development. The principles are taught best by the game itself, with guidance from the coach or trainer. It requires\r\n  commitment and humility to have the patience to allow the game to grow from within the kids through their own experience.\r\n  It demands that coaches remain a student of the game as well as of the craft of coaching. Kids need to develop in a system\r\n  that is firmly committed to the individual's progress, NOT expected to learn to play a system and sacrifice themselves\r\n  and their development for the sake of the team.</p>\r\n<div>Travis L.

It places great demands on individual and team tactical excellence... An absolute prerequisite, to master such a team tactical aspect, is that all the players possess a positive mentality, including the substitutes.\" -Rinus Michels </i></p>\r\n<p>The playmaking style, also known as Total Football, is one of two team strategies, the second being the counter attacking style. These two styles are at the base of all the decisions about how a team will play in a match. The decision which style to adopt will determine the functions and responsibilities inside the team and how to conduct training sessions. The playmaking style is the hardest to prefect and is beyond the capabilities of most youth teams. In order to play this style of soccer certain key ingredient's must be present. Not some, or in some measure, but all and in spades. Without doubt the most important is to take the field with the correct mentality, the 'Amsterdam Bluff' as it's called in Holland.</p>\r\n<p>\"On the day of the 1974 final even West Germany expected Holland to win. 'They were a better team,' said Uli Hoeness later. Winger Bernd Holzenbein recalled: 'In the tunnel, we planned to look them in the eye, to show them we were as big as they were. They had the feeling they were invincible - you could see it in their eyes. Their attitude to us was, \"How many goals do you want to lose by today, boys?\" While we waited to go onto the pitch I tried to look them in the eye, but I couldn't do it. They made us feel small.\"</p>\r\n<p>Sjaak Swart on Ajax: \"When we played in our own stadium, teams who came here were afraid of us. In the bus they were already trembling. Many old players have told me this. Before the game started, it was already 1-0 to us.\" </p>\r\n<h4>Key Ingredient's For Playmaking Soccer</h4>\r\n<p>The predicted outcome determines choice. The playmaking style is only effective when you believe, and can back up, that you are better then the opponents, see above. If the predicted outcome is 4-0 to you, you can do what you like. If it's 4-0 to the opponents then you'll do what the opponents want you to do. One goal games, 1-0, 2-1 present a problem. While you can attempt to use the playmaking style, you're likely to be spending a good deal of time in the counter attacking style as well. Everyone in the team must understand and accept the decisions about how the team will play, that it is the best choice in the given situation. </p>\r\n<p>Trust. The players must have complete confidence in themselves and each other. That the plan is correct and everyone is capable of carrying out their part. This is only possible when the players really know one another, when they play 'instinctively.' Youth teams usually don't have enough time together to reach this level. Swart observed \"It came from playing together a long time.\"  The playmaking style is a high risk style. It requires very high ambition and very low fear of failure on the part of everyone. \"However, structural team building makes sure that: the players have confidence in each other, there is calmness in the games actions, the essential team spirit and team tactical views are present.\"</p>\r\n<p>Higher level of TIC and fitness then the opponents. If the opponents are better in some area of the game they can provide sufficient problems that the playmaking style becomes too difficult. They can either become the playmakers themselves or so dangerous on the counter attack that fear becomes a factor. In the first case the opponents can have the ball a lot, and the playmaking style assumes that they won't. This means that you'll be defending, playing negative soccer, more then you'd like and expending energy in ways and areas that are not a part of the plan. In the second, fear leads to a safety first approach and this runs contrary to the mentality of the playmaking style, calculated risk taking. The team can play too conservatively, hesitate and become so preoccupied with what the opponents might do that they forget about what has to be done. (This applies to every member of the team. In a close game any weakness in even a single player can defeat everyone's work.)</p>\r\n<p>Since most of the game will be played in the opponents half players will find little space and often play in a numbers down situations, i.e. 1v2, 2v4 and so on. Superior technique is a prerequisite to maintaining the necessary speed of play. Without it players will lack confidence and the ability to maintain the attacking pressure.</p>\r\n<p>A higher level of insight and communication is necessary in order to seize opportunities. The correct moment to act will involve two or more players and there is not enough time for anyone to call instructions, let alone get any from the coach. Everyone must read the situation in the same way and arrive at the same conclusion. They must simultaneously act in a split second. The playmaking style involves a lot of nonverbal cues and communication. It is read, react and think later.</p>\r\n<p>The fitness level needs to be very high. Constant changes in tempo and prolonged periods of elevated speed of play takes a toll both physically and mentally. The key players have the responsibility for determining the match tempo. It needs to faster then the opponents can handle but within the capabilities of the team. And remember the old adage, sometimes you have to go slower to go faster.</p>\r\n<p>Adaptability. Mobility, the interchange of positions, is very important, but, so is speed. Players will need to cover for each other as they take advantage of opportunities but this must be done quickly and without hurting team efficiency. This means that players who switch positions usually do so with the players closest to them, i.e. right back and right midfielder or left wing and center forward. Every player must have mastered all of the basics in defending and attacking skills, notably both sides of 1v1 so that they can handle the demands of their temporary positions. </p>\r\n<p>Specific roles. Teams line up at the start of a game for a purpose. To get the best out of each individual and to hide any weakness. The central defender and the center forward are the best available for their jobs at that moment . So if the central defender spends too much time up top then at least two positions are being occupied by players who are not ideally suited for the roles. This upsets the balance inside of the team and results in less efficient, slower, play. The interchange between positions is temporary and players need to resume their key functions as quickly as possible. Sometimes it is only a limited number of players that have the actual 'freedom' to change positions. The majority of the team constitutes the 'work talent' which, by definition, play in the service of the 'key players.' This does not relieve the 'key players' of any burden. Just the opposite, they have the added responsibility of leadership and having to use 'their extra qualities' in order to win the game. In this situation, while the 'work talents' can lose the game, they do not have to win it. </p>\r\n<p>Concentration. Mental fitness is just as important as physical fitness. A break in concentration by a single player can disrupt the entire team effort and start a chain of events that can lead to disaster. The playmaking style requires tremendous concentration for long periods, like driving at high speed in heavy traffic for long distances. It is stressful and wearing. It is also presents a problem when a substitute comes on and is not up to the mental speed of the game. </p>\r\n<p>The attack starts where you win the ball. In the playmaking style it means defending in the opponents half. This prevents the opponents from retreating and, as long as you can prevent the deep pass, reduces the space in which to 'hunt' the ball. </p>\r\n<p><i>\"The main aim of the attacking pressure football, the 'hunt', was: regaining possession as soon as possible after the ball was lost on the opponents half during an attack. The 'trapping' of the opponents on their own half is only then possible when all the lines are pushed up and play close together. This automatically means that you give away a lot of space on your own half and you are vulnerable to counterattacks... You need to control the opponent if you want to play an attacking style football!\"  </i></p>\r\n<p>The 'hunt' means two or even three players pressurize the player with the ball. The idea is that the first won't win the ball but forces a hurried pass. The second defender immediately applies pressure to the receiver forcing another hurried pass so that the third defender can win the ball. The 'hunt' is not strictly a man to man or zone defending scheme. Instead, every opponent ahead of the ball is marked and the rest of the team marks the players and space in the vicinity of the ball. Opponents who are behind the ball or in positions where they couldn't do much if they got it, the least dangerous men, are left free. This allows the defenders to concentrate in the area around the ball. They must still watch opponents, tracking down any that attempt to move forward and, above all, prevent the deep pass into the space behind the last line of defenders. When this is done in the opponents half it puts the attackers under tremendous pressure. Only when the opponents are able to successfully relieve the pressure will a playmaking team retreat back closer to their own goal. </p>\r\n<p>When the ball is regained it is critical that it is not given back. Ideally, winning the ball in the opponents half should present an immediate scoring opportunity. However, the space is likely to be very crowded. In that case the ball should be protected by passing it quickly to a supporting player and away from danger. Young players can get 'ramped up' when they're defending and lack the composure to make the correct decision, (to build up or counter) when they come out of a tackle. They often simply give the ball back to the opponents and have to start defending all over again. </p>\r\n<p>Learning the playmaking style is very difficult. It is designed as a means of breaking down packed defenses. It requires that the team master rapid ball circulation, both sides of 1v1, a lightning response to a change in possession, the ability to work in very limited space, the ability to change the tempo, speed, of the game and the ability to maintain concentration for prolonged periods under great stress. A tall order for young players. If their education is only started at 11 a side then only the best will be able to grasp the fundamentals and be able to contribute to the game as they get older. </p>\r\n<p>\"This risky style of play demands individually a lot of football capacity. It entails that you often have to operate in small spaces during the build up and attack and defend large spaces with few players. This style of play requires a methodical process in the youth program, and also specific types of players; such as wing forwards and defenders who get involved in the attack.\" </p>\r\n<p>Games like 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 can serve as the starting point and building blocks for developing not only the skills, but the mentality for playing this style of soccer and assist in youth development. </p>\r\n<p>The lighter area in the diagram shows the space where playmaking teams prefer to play. The orange team has committed all ten field players to the opponents half and their goal keeper has come forward to act as a sweeper behind the back line. As long as they can keep the game in this space they face little danger and the opponents will be under constant pressure. The danger for the playmaking teams is the space behind the last line of defenders. A single long pass to a fast forward can put ten orange players out of the game. The defensive phase must involve the entire team. Playmaking teams cannot function against quality opponents with a sweeper that plays ten yards behind the back line or forwards that will not, or cannot pressurize. They will lose the battle in the midfield and have to start their attacks too deep in their own half. Simply put, it is more then just quick ball circulation, the rapid interchange of positions and all out attacking play. Without a clear commitment by everyone to do the dirty work necessary to regain the ball and neutralize the opponents it is more risky then the return brings. In fact, without the high pressure defensive 'hunt' and a smooth, quick, efficient transition from defending to attacking/building up play the playmaking style is difficult if not impossible to pull off. </p>\r\n<p>\"The advantage of this play-making style is that you are capable of playing it under all circumstances. You always take the initiative, and you must do that. However, if you fail to carry the play and get under pressure, then the opponent will take advantage of the weak aspects of the style you are playing.\"</p>\r\n"
