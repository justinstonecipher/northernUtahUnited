<h4>We Want the Recreational Player to Feel Special and Have Fun Too!</h4>
<p>The Cache Valley Mini Cup provides recreational youth soccer players an opportunity to experience a consistent and high quality
  tournament just like their counterparts in the competition programs, in a fun, family-like atmosphere.</p>
<p>The tournament is designed to encourage and honor the recreational player by allowing the player to compete for both team
  and personal goals. This tournament is structured so that, regardless of ability, all players can realistically strive
  for the goal of being a champion.</p>
<p>Any Recreational teams U6 - U18 organized during the Spring 2015 season are invited to come and participate and showcase
  their talent. This recreation tournament is open to all recreational teams registered through UYSA - statewide. Recommended
  teams size is 6 - 8 players (larger teams may be divided into two teams and registered separately).</p>
<p>It is our philosophy that all players should receive equal opportunities and benefits within their level of play. Further,
  all players have the right to participate, in competitions where they can be honored as winners.</p>

<h4>What happened th the Kohl's American Cup?</h4>
<p>The American cup is a national program sponsored by US Youth Soccer Association and Kohl’s Department stores. Each year,
  organizations around the country apply to have the American Cup experience come to their community. For the past 18 years,
  we have applied to host an American Cup, and been selected. This year, we were not selected. According to US Youth Soccer,
  they wanted to reach out to organizations other states that have never had the opportunity to host an American Cup.</p>
<p>So, we have decided that in the years that we are not chosen to host an American Cup, we will still hold a recreational tournament
  anyway. In order to be consistent, we will use the same rules and policies, but the tournament will be called the Cache
  Valley Mini Cup – Recreational Tournament. Yogurtland, has been generous enough to give us a major sponsorship for the
  tournament, and make it possible for us to continue to host this event within our community. Many thanks to the Yogurtland
  for helping us make it happen!</p>
