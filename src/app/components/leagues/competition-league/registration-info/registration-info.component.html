          teams to get our top athletes to Showcase tournaments and be seen by college recruiters; Adding a developmental
          Academy for our U7/U8's (above); Camps and training opportunities; and other services. These additional services will be

          succeed at the highest level in youth soccer.

            need to make sure you get player and coach photos uploaded as soon as possible.

          <p>Teams going to in-state tournaments will likely only need a tournament photo roster to play, but teams attending
            out of state tournaments will likely need player cards. Contact Terri Baker at terribaker1@live.com or 753-8202

          <h4>Field Approval</h4>
          <p>You must get field approval for use of all fields. Your team registration will not be accepted without the appropriate
            field approval signatures.
          </p>
          <p>Using our city fields is a privilege, we suggest that all coaches work with their teams to make sure that we are
            respectful regarding the use of these fields to help us ensure that we may continue to keep fees as low as possible,
            and to ensure that we may continue to use them. Please make sure that your team picks up all trash before leaving
            the fields, and be cautious not to play on overly wet fields, or encourage any activities which may result in
            damage to the playing fields.
          </p>
          <p>Many fields are in great demand, and we cannot guarantee that all teams will get the fields that they request.
            To have the best chance of getting the home field that you would like, please contact the field rep as soon as
            possible. We will be limited the number of teams on each field, to ensure that fields are not overused.
          </p>
          <p>Field Representative information is at the bottom of this page (Click Here).
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h4>Field Marking</h4>
          <p>All teams should be prepared to take a turn in marking fields, if needed. Each team should be able to find two
            or three volunteers to help mark their fields before and during the season. If every team participates, it is
            little work for everyone, rather than a huge job for someone. NUU will take care of the cost of the paint, and
            provide the field marking equipment.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h4>Field Equipment</h4>
          <p>Every field should be equipped with goals and nets, (except fields in the Brigham City area, where nets may be
            required of every home team, for each game), however all teams should have their own set of corner flags. It
            is the responsibility of the Home team to provide the corner flags for each game. Corner flags can easily be
            found online for less than $20.00 - up to about $45.00. (Check out Sator Soccer online at: www.satorsports.com
            ) Coaches can also find other equipment at this site, like Goalkeeper equipment, training equipment, etc.) Also,
            you can check our website’s Resource page for specials from local vendors and others.
          </p>
          <hr>-->
          <!--<h4>Medical Releases</h4>
          <p>As part of the player online registration process, parents will be prompted to print a copy of their registration
            form and sign it and give it to the head coach. This copy of the registration can be used as a medical release
            in case a player is injured in a game or practice and the parents are not present to give their permission for
            medical treatment.
          </p>
          <p>You will need to have these medical releases at every practice and at every game. They will also be required for
            check in at most tournaments. Make sure you remind all players to turn in a copy of their registration form to
            you.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h4>Play Up Rule</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No player younger than U8 may play in any competition program.
        </strong></li>
            <li>Players who are U8 - U10 may not be registered to a team that competes in an age group more than one year older
              than the player’s age group.
            </li>
            <li>Players who are U11 - U14 may not be registered to a team that competes in an age group more than two years older
              than the player’s age group.
            </li>
            <li>Players U15 or older may play up without restriction.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <h4>Multiple Rostering</h4>
          <p>Multiple rostering allows players to play on two teams at the same time. Players must be U11 or older and both
            teams must play at the same level of play, ie: State or Challenger. Additionally, the teams must be in different
            age brackets - AND - play in different divisions. Players must pay fees for both teams. U11 teams can have no
            more than 6 Multi-rostered players and U12 and older teams may have no more than 8 Multi-rostered players.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <h4>Developmental Pass - Challenger League Only
          </h4>
          <p>The developmental pass is a tool that allows a team to ‘borrow’ a player from another team on a limited basis.
            Players may only developmental pass within the same level of play, and between teams within the same organization.
            Each player may developmental pass a total of six times, and a team may only developmental pass 3 player in any
            given game. This is a coach managed program, but must be done through the online registration program (Affinity
            or ADG). The complete policy and instructions on how to use the Developmental pass is available on our website.
