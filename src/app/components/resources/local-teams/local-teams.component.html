<h2>Local Teams Compete in National Tournament</h2>
<p>After winning their age group championship in the Utah State Presidentâ€™s Cup earlier this year, the Infinity SC '97 (U15 girls) and Internationals '98 (U14 boys) teams are on their way to Arvada Colorado (near Denver) to compete in US Youth Soccer's President's Cup Region IV Qualifier.</p>
<p>The regional qualifiers, will determine the teams competing in the US Youth Soccer National President Cup, July 11-14, 2012, in Sacramento California. </p>
<p>The Infinity girls are coached by Sherri Dever and Jennie Jenson, the Internationals boys by JC Vazquez and Jeff Woods. Each team competed in the UYSA State Premier division this spring. The Internationals will be competing this fall as "Northern Utah United Boys '98 Premier" and because all 18 players from Infinity '97 competed for either Mountain Crest, Sky View or Logan High Schools last fall we wont be seeing them compete as a team again until next spring.</p>
<p>We would also like to reconize the Infinity SC Girls '03 Blue (U9) team for their Silver Division Championship and the Infinity SC Girls '96 Premier for their apperance in the finals where they lost 0-1 to Avalanche 96 White.</p>
